    How to fetch orders from the OpenSea system.

    Parameters
    ----------
    client_params:
        ClientParams instance.

    asset_contract_address: str
        Filter by smart contract address for the asset category.
        Needs to be defined together with token_id or token_ids.

    payment_token_address: str
        Filter by the address of the smart contract of the payment
        token that is accepted or offered by the order

    maker: str
        Filter by the order maker's wallet address

    taker: str
        Filter by the order taker's wallet address.
        Orders open for any taker have the null address as their taker.

    owner: str
        Filter by the asset owner's wallet address

    is_english: bool
        When "true", only show English Auction sell orders, which wait for the highest bidder.
        When "false", exclude those.

    bundled: bool
        Only show orders for bundles of assets

    include_bundled: bool
        Include orders on bundles where all assets in the bundle share the address
        provided in asset_contract_address or where the bundle's maker is the address provided in owner.

    include_invalid: bool
        Include orders marked invalid by the orderbook, typically due to makers
        not owning enough of the token/asset anymore.

    listed_after: datetime
        Only show orders listed after this timestamp.

    listed_before: datetime
        Only show orders listed before this timestamp.

    token_id: str
        Filter by the token ID of the order's asset.
        Needs to be defined together with asset_contract_address.

    token_ids: list[str]
        Filter by a list of token IDs for the order's asset.
        Needs to be defined together with asset_contract_address.

    side: int
        Filter by the side of the order.
        0 for buy orders and 1 for sell orders.

    sale_kind: int
        Filter by the kind of sell order.
        0 for fixed-price sales or min-bid auctions, and 1 for declining-price Dutch Auctions.
        NOTE=use only_english=true for filtering for only English Auctions

    order_by: str
        How to sort the orders. Can be created_date for when they were made,
        or eth_price to see the lowest-priced orders first (converted to their ETH values).
        eth_price is only supported when asset_contract_address and token_id are also defined.

    order_direction: str
        Can be asc or desc for ascending or descending sort.
        For example, to see the cheapest orders, do order_direction asc and order_by eth_price.
